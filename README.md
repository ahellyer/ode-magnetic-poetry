Ode is a react application that pays tribute to the fridge magnet poetry sets of the 90's. Users can input a topic, and a number of calls to the Datamuse API will return a random mix of nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Features include autosuggest, a profanity filter, drag and drop (utilizing react-beautiful-dnd) and the ability to share your poem with a unique url that pulls your data from firebase.
